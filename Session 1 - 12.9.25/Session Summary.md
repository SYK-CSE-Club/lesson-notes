# Session Summary: Coding Tools, VS Code, Git & Basics

- What programs have you installed and what are they for?
  
  - VS Code --> IDE
    - This is like a special notepad for writing code. It helps you write, check for mistakes, and run your programs all in one place.
  
  - Python --> Programming Language
    - known for its simplicity and readability. Widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, etc.
  
  - Git
    - A version control system that tracks changes in your code over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and manage project history.
    - it is like a time machine for your code. It saves versions of your work so you can go back if you make a mistake or work with friends on the same project.

- What is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)?

  - An IDE is a software application that provides tools for programming, including a code editor, debugger, compiler, and often features like version control and extensions. It makes the coding process faster and easier by combining multiple tools into one interface, making it easier to write, test, and debug code efficiently.
  
  - Why do programmers use IDEs?
    - It helps you write code faster by suggesting words, finding errors, and testing your work. Without it, you'd have to use separate programs for each task, which is more confusing and slower.
  
  - Why is VS Code a popular choice?
    - VS Code is free to download and use. It's lightweight (doesn't slow down your computer), and you can add additional extensions to make it do more. It works with many languages, has a simple look, and connects easily to tools like Git. That's why lots of people use it.

- Getting to know VS Code:
  
  - Exploring the interface: sidebar, editor, files explorer
    - When you open VS Code, you'll see a sidebar on the left with buttons for switching between different views. The big middle area is where you type your code (the editor). The file explorer view in the left sidebar lets you see and open your project files.
  
  - Using features: extensions, built-in terminal, different views
    - Extensions are add-ons you can install to make VS Code better, like adding support for a new language. The built-in terminal is a mini command window inside VS Code for running commands. Views are panels that show things like errors in your code or Git changes.
  
  - Some keyboard shortcuts (copy, search, open terminal, etc.)
    - Shortcuts save time! Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Ctrl+F searches in your file. Ctrl+Shift+F searches your whole project. Ctrl+` opens the terminal. Ctrl+Shift+P lets you open the command palette, which is sort of like a search bar for all VS Code commands. You can type to find and run any command without using menus.
  
  - Recommended extensions (Python, Git, Reload, Live Server, etc)
    - Python extension: Helps with writing Python code by suggesting completions and fixing errors, and allows you to Run/debug python code in VS Code.
    - Live Server: Refreshes your browser automatically when you are doing web-development/programming.
    - Reload: Small tool to quickly reload vscode incase of problems or extension updates

- Organizing your coding projects (basics):
  
  - Create one main 'Coding' folder, and then have subfolders inside for projects
    - Keep things tidy! Make a folder called 'Coding' on your computer (like in your user folder or in Documents). Inside it, make subfolders for each project, such as 'My First Python App' or 'Web Experiments'. This way, you won't mix up your files, and can always find what you need.

- Using the Terminal:
  
  * Basic overview (what? why?)
    * The terminal is a text window where you type commands to talk to your computer. It's like giving instructions directly instead of clicking buttons. It is used because some tools only work this way, and it's quicker for many tasks.
  
  * commands: navigation (cd, ls/dir)
    * cd means "change directory" â€“ type cd followed by a folder name to go there (e.g., cd Desktop).
    * ls (or dir in CMD/Command Prompt) lists the files in your current folder, so you can see what's there.
  
  * When and why to use the terminal for coding
    * Use the terminal to install programs (like Python packages with pip), run your code, or manage Git. It's useful for things you can't do with mouse clicks, like starting a web server or compiling programs.
      - note: will talk about and explain this later

- Introduction to Git & GitHub:
  
  - What is version control (git) and why is it important?
    - Version control tracks every change you make to your files, like a history book. Git does this locally on your computer. It's important so you don't lose work, can undo mistakes, and share code with others safely.
  
  - Creating GitHub accounts and logging into GitHub
    - Go to github.com in your browser. Click "Sign up" and enter your email and a password. Check your email to verify. Then log in anytime to access your projects online.
  
  - Basic Git actions in VS Code (add, commit, push)
    - Add: Tells Git which files to save changes for. 
    - Commit: Saves those changes with a note (like "Added new feature").
    - Push: Sends your commits to GitHub (the server/cloud) so others or only you can see them (Public vs Private repositories).
  
  - What are repositories, branches, and commits?
    - A repository (repo) is like a folder for your project that Git watches.
    - Branches are like separate copies of your code for trying new ideas.
    - Commits are saved points in time, each with a message explaining what changed.
  
  - Git vs GitHub
    - Git is the tool on your computer that handles the history and changes. GitHub is a website where you store your Git repos online, so you can share and collaborate with friends or the world.
