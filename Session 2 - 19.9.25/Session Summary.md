# Session Summary: GitHub, Open Source, Markdown & Python Basics

- **Exploring GitHub UI:**
	- Went through the most commonly used pages and elements on GitHub, including repositories, file view, issues, pull requests, downloading code/cloning a repo and other features. 
    - Focused on understanding how developers use GitHub to collaborate.

- **What is Open Source Software?**
	- Discussed the concept of open source software, how it is developed, and why it is important. 
    - The benefits of open collaboration (leads to innovation) and how anyone can contribute to projects.

- **Key Documentation Files in Projects:**
	- Examined important files found in open source repositories, such as `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` and `LICENSE` (most commonly used one is MIT).
    - Discussed their structure, purpose, and why they are needed to help users and contributors understand, use, and improve projects.

- **Markdown Format Guide:**
	- in-depth dive into Markdown, the simple formatting language used for documentation on GitHub and elsewhere.
    - Headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, and best practices for writing clear documentation.

- **Python Programming Basics:**
	- Introduced Python and wrote a simple program together. Topics discussed:
		- Variables
		- Control structures: `if`, `elif`, `else`
		- Loops: `while` and `for`
        - Writing a factorial program using both `while` and `for` loops
        - Boolean logic (basics)

- Markdown [Extended guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)

## Homework

- read the session summary and review the content covered in the lesson (try to recall what was covered from each topic)
- Create a markdown file and write a short readme about a project you want to do/work on in the future. Use this [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) or the cheatsheet above for help.
- For additional practice, you can also write a simple python program
