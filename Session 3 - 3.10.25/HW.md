# Homework

- Do as many problems as you can in the [CSE_CLUB_PROBLEMS.pdf](CSE_CLUB_PROBLEMS.pdf)
- As a bonus, learn about the Walrus Operator (`:=`) in Python. It's a handy feature introduced in Python 3.8 that allows you to assign values to variables within expressions. Search for tutorials or documentation online, and try to understand its usage with some simple examples. Feel free to ask questions if you have any!
